/*ince dense_rank() is applied over a window,
 the result must adhere to the SQL rule that every column in the
 SELECT clause either appears in the GROUP BY clause or is part of an aggregate/window function. /

Not applicable here: In your query, the goal is to rank all states by their 
--  Market_size across the entire datasetâ€”not separately within groups.
 -- Therefore, you use order by Market_size without partition by.
