        "6. **Limitations of SQL** -\n",
        "          1.Complexity: SQL can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners unfamiliar with database design and programming concepts.\n",
        "          2.Limited Support for Non-Relational Data: SQL is specifically designed for relational databases, which may not be ideal for managing non-relational data formats like JSON or XML.\n",
        "          3.Cost: Some SQL-based database management systems are expensive to license, particularly for large-scale enterprise applications.4.Scalability Challenges: Although SQL is scalable, managing very large datasets with a centralized architecture can pose challenges and lead to performance bottlenecks.\n",
        "          5.Performance Issues with Large Datasets: SQL may experience performance degradation when handling exceptionally large datasets or highly complex queries, potentially impacting user experience."

        "### INDEXES -\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In SQL, an index is a **database object** that significantly improves the speed of data retrieval operations **by creating a data structure that holds pointers to rows in a table.**\n",
        "\n",
        " Just like an index in a book helps you quickly find a topic by pointing to the pages where it's discussed, an SQL index points to the location of data within a table, enabling faster query performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How Does an Index Work? - An index works by creating an **ordered data structure (usually a B-Tree)** that allows the database to quickly locate the row or rows that match a specific query condition.\n",
        "\n",
        " Instead of scanning the entire table row by row (which is known as a full table scan), the database can use the index to jump to the location of the required rows more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        " Analogy:Index created in the book\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How SQL Indexes are Implemented- Most relational databases implement indexes using a B-Tree or B+Tree data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This tree structure allows for **logarithmic time complexity (O(log n))** when searching for data, which is much faster than a full table scan, especially as the size of the table grows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example of a B-Tree Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Nodes: Each node in the B-Tree represents a range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Pointers: The B-Tree stores pointers to the actual rows in the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ordering: The tree is kept in a sorted order, making it easy to traverse.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  When a query is executed, the database engine uses the index to navigate the tree and quickly find the required rows, reducing the number of disk accesses needed to retrieve the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why Are Indexes Important?\n",
        "Indexes are critical for improving the performance of queries, especially in large databases.\n",
        "\n",
        " Without indexes, SQL queries that involve searching (WHERE clause), sorting (ORDER BY), or joining (JOIN clauses) would require the database to scan every row in the table, which can be extremely slow when dealing with large amounts of data.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " **CREATE INDEX idx_name_department ON employees (LastName, Department);**\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.Unique Index: - Ensures that the values in the indexed column(s) are unique, preventing duplicate values.\n",
        "This is **automatically created for primary key constraints, but can also be defined explicitly.**\n",
        "\n",
        " **CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON employees (Email);**\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **View** in SQL is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query.\n",
        "\n",
        " It does not store data itself, but rather, it dynamically retrieves data from one or more underlying tables each time it is queried.\n",
        "\n",
        " Views allow users to simplify complex queries, hide data complexity, and control access to specific data without altering the original tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key Characteristics of Views:**\n",
        "\n",
        " 1.Virtual Table: A view is not a physical table; it does not store data. It only stores the SQL query used to generate the data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.Dynamic Data: Data in a view is dynamic and reflects the changes made in the underlying tables.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.Simplification: Views can simplify complex queries by abstracting the SQL query logic.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.Security: Views can restrict access to specific rows and columns, allowing users to see only the data they need.\n",
        "\n",
        " **CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name WHERE condition;**\n",
        "\n",
        " CREATE VIEW employee_salaries AS SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM employees;\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Types of Views:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  1.Simple View: Based on a single table without any functions or joins.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Complex View: Involves multiple tables and can include joins, group functions, or subqueries.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Advantages of Views:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Simplified Queries: Complex SQL logic can be encapsulated in a view.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Data Security: Users can be restricted to specific data by allowing access only through views.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Data Abstraction: Views provide a layer of abstraction between users and the actual table structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Limitations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   No Data Storage: Since views don't store data, querying a view may be slower if the underlying query is complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Non-Updateable Views: In some cases, especially with complex views involving joins or group functions, views may not be updateable, meaning you cannot modify data through the view.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Modifying Data Through a View: - If the view is based on a single table without joins, and includes all required columns, you can INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data through the view, which will affect the underlying table."
