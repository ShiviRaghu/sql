        "          1.Complexity: SQL can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners unfamiliar with database design and programming concepts.\n",
        "          2.Limited Support for Non-Relational Data: SQL is specifically designed for relational databases, which may not be ideal for managing non-relational data formats like JSON or XML.\n",
        "          3.Cost: Some SQL-based database management systems are expensive to license, particularly for large-scale enterprise applications.4.Scalability Challenges: Although SQL is scalable, managing very large datasets with a centralized architecture can pose challenges and lead to performance bottlenecks.\n",
