        "   It enables users to create, modify, and manipulate data structures and records.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   SQL is commonly employed to query, insert, update, and delete records, as well as to design and alter the database itself.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   With its versatility, SQL can handle complex queries and process large volumes of data, making it the most widely used language for managing databases across various applications.\n",

        "6. **Limitations of SQL** -\n",
        "          1.Complexity: SQL can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners unfamiliar with database design and programming concepts.\n",
        "          2.Limited Support for Non-Relational Data: SQL is specifically designed for relational databases, which may not be ideal for managing non-relational data formats like JSON or XML.\n",
        "          3.Cost: Some SQL-based database management systems are expensive to license, particularly for large-scale enterprise applications.4.Scalability Challenges: Although SQL is scalable, managing very large datasets with a centralized architecture can pose challenges and lead to performance bottlenecks.\n",
        "          5.Performance Issues with Large Datasets: SQL may experience performance degradation when handling exceptionally large datasets or highly complex queries, potentially impacting user experience."
